# The following comments provide detailed explanations for beginners:
# 1. The Disassembler class is responsible for converting bytecode into human-readable instructions.
# 2. The Debugger class simulates the execution of instructions, fetching them from memory and disassembling them.
# 3. The Injector class simulates code injection, allowing modification of code at specific memory addresses.
# 4. In the example usage, we create instances of the Disassembler, Debugger, and Injector classes.
# 5. We initialize a simulated memory with some fictional bytecode.
# 6. The debugger steps through the memory, disassembling and printing instructions.
# 7. We use the injector to modify the bytecode in memory, demonstrating how an instruction can be patched.
# 8. Finally, we print the modified instruction to show the effect of the injection.
